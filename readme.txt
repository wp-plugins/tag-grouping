Requires at least: 2.9.1
Tested up to: 2.9.2
Stable tag: 1.4

Create logical and meaningful groups of tags. Update old posts by updating your tag group. Add tags in bulk with 1 selection.

== Description ==

With a few simple steps you can transform your tags into a manageable bunch of groups. No more clicking on each tag for every post or pasting in a long string of tags.
Now, with Tag Grouping, you can enable a checkbox for each group of tags you wish to associate with a post. When you save that post, the tags are added as if you were using the normal
WordPress interface. As an added bonus, if you decide to alter a group of tags later and add more tags, all your posts with that group will receive the updated tag list.

Creation of groups just got simpler with version 1.1. Now you can paste in your list of tags during the creation process and the plugin will automatically take care of splitting
them up, comparing them to the existing tags, adding new ones to your database and adding all of them to your group.

In a nutshell:

* Create groups of tags quickly and easily that can be used on any post.
* Retroactively add tags to multiple posts when updating an existing group that is contained by the posts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the contents of the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Create your Groups.
4. Add them to your posts.
5. Send any feedback or suggestions to mike@croutonsoflife.com
